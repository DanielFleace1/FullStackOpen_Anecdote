The challenge is to create a react front end  that displays an anecdote  and allows users to randomly display  different anecdotes. The user can vote on their favorite anecdote and the anecdote with the most votes will be displayed  below the randomly generated anecdote with it's vote count. The anecdote with the most votes will remain displayed until a different anecdote receives more votes.
